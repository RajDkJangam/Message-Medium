Was there a hidden meaning, more than his mere words had indicated, which had passed over the listeners' heads? Surely there could be no serious physical threat in their latest experiments which they were pushing through with such fanatical zeal. The \"Chief\" himself didn't think there was — \"with proper precautions\" but, as he often remarked, \"When you step out into the cold realm of the unknown, strange things are possible.\" No, Professor Mendoza must have referred to the improper, nay inhumanitarian, destructive, even senseless uses to which the greatest of scientific discoveries are often put by the world at large. Perhaps in many ways it might prove only too true that, in the not far distant future, the very life of the race would depend upon how it chose to make use of the new forces released by science.

That is, he had a far keener eye to politics behind adequate finance, and on which side the University's bread, not to mention his own, was buttered, than matters pertaining to mere learning. He was therefore extremely careful of anything in the way of deeds, or even mere unconventional utterances anywhere within the realm of the institution under his jurisdiction, whether by student or teacher, that might offend the delicate sensibilities and still more delicate pocketbooks of the influential donors and keepers of the school. Certain it is, there had been a rumor among those who professed to be in the know, that the dignified Dr. Lorman owed his high position, to an extent few appreciated, to his well-connected political association rather than to his profound educational or other abilities.</p><p>Be that as it may, the good Dr. Lorman was thoroughly dismayed and quite put out by the recent disastrous fire which had wrecked the newest and</p><p>finest building on the campus, and came uncomfortably close to destroying some others. At the same time, to say the least, he was quite annoyed at the distinguished physicist who had been the careless, if unwitting and unhappy cause of the disaster. More than once before,</p><p>since taking office, it had occurred to him, and now came to him with even</p><p>greater certainty, that the physicist, granting his great distinction, had all</p><p>along been allowed too much, altogether too much, of the lately restricted University funds for those never-ending and costly experiments of his. Could there be any doubt of it now? The school needed a new gymnasium, for one thing, much more. There was a crying need voiced by a large and vociferous majority for a new and larger stadium. After all, he had his obligations to the student body, not to mention the alumni. Besides he doubted if the Professor, Considering his age. could accomplish much more anyway. And even allowing for the utmost charitable view, what did the professional work of one man mean alongside the larger needs of the school as a whole ? And since he had for a long time intended to cut down the professor's huge laboratory appropriations, right now was as good a time as any, without arousing too much antagonism on the part of those more scientifically minded.</p><p><br></p>", date: "4,27,2017,2,19,41", topic_id: nil, main_image: URI.parse("https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/message-dev/users/seed_photos/cover11.png"))
